get, since they have full (100%) test coverage. And obviously 100% coverage
is as good as it could possibly get. Or is it not? You guessed it, coverage
isn't everything, The quality of the tests plays a big role as well.</p><p>Here is a little example of full test coverage that isn't very useful:</p><code><pre>
package testme

var (
    someMapping = map[int]string(
        1: &#34;Hello&#34;,
        2: &#34;World&#34;
    )

    OutOfBoundsError = errors.New(&#34;Out of bounds&#34;)
)

func Something(input int) (output string, err error) {
    if input &gt; 0 {
        return someMapping[input], nil
    }

    return &#34;&#34;, OutOfBoundsError
}
</pre></code><code><pre>
package testme_test

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    result, err := Something(1)
    if err != nil {
        t.Error(&#34;result should&#39;ve been &#39;Hello&#39;, but an error was returned&#34;)
    }

    if result != &#34;Hello&#34; {
        t.Errorf(&#34;result should&#39;ve been &#39;Hello&#39;, but was &#39;%s&#39;&#34;, result)
    }

    result, err = Something(2)
    if err != nil {
        t.Error(&#34;result should&#39;ve been &#39;World&#39;, but an error was returned&#34;)
    }

    if result != &#34;World&#34; {
        t.Errorf(&#34;result should&#39;ve been &#39;World&#39;, but was &#39;%s&#39;&#34;, result)
    }

    result, err = Somethng(0)
    if err != nil {
        t.Error(&#34;call should&#39;ve returned an error, but it didn&#39;t&#34;)
    }
}
</pre></code><p>This code will test all statements, meaning that it will have full coverage.
But it won't test all theoretically possible cases. When calling <code>Something</code>
with <code>3</code>, we will get an empty string instead of the expected error, since
accessing a non-existent key in a map will return the types default value.</p><p>If you wanna test this out for yourself, go ahead and run this:</p><code><pre>
package main

import &#34;fmt&#34;

func main() {
    wow := map[int]int{2: 4}
    fmt.Println(wow[1])
}
</pre></code><p>So whenever you write a test, don't look at the code coverage first, instead
pay attention to whether you have tested all possible cases. However, if a
function doesn't have full coverage, that is probably an indicator for cases
that aren't handled or even <abbr title="code that can never be called, no matter what happens">useless code</abbr>.</p><script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="Bios-Marcel/bios-marcel.github.io" issue-term="title" theme="preferred-color-scheme" async>
