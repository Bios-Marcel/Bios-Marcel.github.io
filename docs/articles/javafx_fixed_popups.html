I am currently working on a small autocompletion text field. I want the
component to show a small popup with completion possibilities whenever any are
available at the current cursor location.
I thought "That's gotta be easy, just call `new Popup()` and invoke `show()` ...
well, it didn't work too well. The popup would initially show correctly, but
also not hide clicking anywhere. This is due to the fact you have to set
`autoHide` to `true`.
After setting `autoHide`, it would however hide when you move the window or
click in some area that can't receive focus anyway. This means the text field
would still have focus, but no popup showing. This is quite annoying, as this
means we can't bind the popup visiblity to the focus. While a workaround would
be to listen to `KeyEvent` and `MouseEvent` to re-show the popup, this is janky.
Time to make my own popup I guess?
I found an [interesting post guiding me the right
way](https://quollwriter.wordpress.com/2019/04/08/how-to-create-a-popup-pane-in-javafx/).
This solution would allow me to freely place any component inside of a `Pane`.
The only issue with this solution, is that it changes the bounds of the popups
parent. So our hierarchy Would Be `Pane(TextField, Popup)`.
To solve the layouting issue, the following rough setup is required:
```java
final var textField = new TextField("I am a TextField");
final var popup = new Label("I am a Popup");
popup.setVisible(false);
popup.setManaged(false);
final var pane = new Pane();
pane.getChildren().addAll(textField, popup);
pane.maxHeightProperty().bind(textField.heightProperty());
pane.maxWidthProperty().bind(textField.widthProperty());
showPopup();
```
Calling `setManaged(false)` on the `popup` will prevent it from being layouted,
but also prevent it from expanding the parent in size. Since the parent is now
bound to the size of the `textField`, we won't be pushing other components in
the layout.
However, since `popup` isn't being layouted, it does not have a position.
While the methods `setLayoutX` and `setLayoutY` exist, they have no effect, as
we are effectively not part of a layout. Instead we need to call `setTranslateY`
and `setTranslateX`:
```java
private void showPopup() {
popup.setVisible(true);
final var textFieldBounds = textField.getBoundsInParent();
popup.setTranslateY(textFieldBounds.getMaxY());
popup.setTranslateX(textFieldBounds.getMinX());
...
}
```
In order to show the text field, we need to always bring all components in its
hierarchy to the front, as the popup will otherwise render partially behind
other components in any nested layout. However, calling `Node#toFront` will
actually reposition the nodes. Instead, we set the `viewOrder` to a negative
value for the full node hierarchy:
```java
private void showPopup() {
...
toFront(popup);
}
private void toFront(Node node) {
node.setViewOrder(-1);
if (node.getParent() != null) {
toFront(node.getParent());
}
}
```
I hope someone can make use of this wild hack ðŸ˜€
