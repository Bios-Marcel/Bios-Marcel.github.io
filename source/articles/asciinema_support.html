title: Asciinema Support For My Blog!

<p>I often want to have console output in my blogposts. Since I don't want to
    upload videos, due to their size, I just create code boxes.</p>

<p>However, I thought it'd also be cool to use asciinema, but I didn't want
    to rely on their servers. Thankfully you can embed the player JS and
    selfhost the files!</p>

<p>While the API is a bit awkward, as you manually have to inject the components
    into `div` elements, it does work like a charm.

<p>To embed an asciicast into a blogpost, all I have to do now, is this:</p>

<code>
    <pre>&lt;asciicast src='/media/demo.cast' /&gt;</pre>
</code>

<p>Which is then automatically turned into this:</p>

<asciicast src="/media/demo.cast" />

<p>This partially happens at generation time and partially at runtime. The goal
    is to avoid loading any additional JS or stylesheet if possible.</p>
