<p>Every now and then I get E-Mails (or messages on
    certain services) from a recruiter. Most of the time, these people are very
    unlikable.</p>

<p>They act like you have a super interesting profile, even though
    you don't. They won't look at the work you've done, neither the professional
    work, nor the open source stuff. They won't care about what you've configured
    the preferences for your next job to be, they don't care about what you like
    or dislike. They don't care what city you want to work in, whether you want to
    work remotely (or in an office, like me) or whether you aren't interested in
    full-time offers. They don't even care whether you've ignored their previous
    20 messages. They also try their hardest to get your telephone number, so they
    can annoy you every now and then.</p>

<p>At some point, one of them even called my (back then) employer
    and told them I talked to them about a job change and that we had an
    appointment, which was simply untrue.

<p><b>Please give a shit about the people you want to hire :)</b></p>
