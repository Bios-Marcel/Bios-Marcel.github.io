{{define "content"}}<p>Every now and then I get E-Mails (or messages on
certain services) from a recruiter. Most of the time, these people are very
unlikable.</p>

<p>They act like you have a super interesting profile, even though
you don't. They won't look at the work you've done, neither the professional
work, nor the open source stuff. They won't care about what you've configured
the preferences for your next job to be, they don't care about what you like
or dislike. They don't care what city you want to work, whether you want to
work remotely or not or how many hours you want to do per week. They don't
even care whether you've ignored their previous 20 messages. They also try
their hardest to get your telephone number, so they can annoy you every now
and then.</p>

<p>At some point, one of them even called my (back then) employer
and told them I talked to them about a job change and that we had an
appointment, which was simply untrue.<p>

<p><b>Please give a shit about the people you want to hire :)</b></p>{{end}}
