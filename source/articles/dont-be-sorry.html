<p>Something I have noticed in the open source community
and also in myself specifically, is that people feel guilty for things they
don't do. You haven't answered that issue from a week ago, just because you
didn't feel like it? You forgot fixing that terrible bug in that library you
started making for fun, but others started relying on? You don't feel like
keeping up work on a certain thing anymore or heavily slow down your pace?
Don't feel sorry! You are doing all of this in your free time. YOUR free
time.</p>

<p>Users of software, whether it's end-user applications, libraries or
whatever, will always have expectations. However, YOU don't have to meet
these. You haven't signed a contract, you aren't being paid and you probably
haven't promised anyone anything.</p>

<p>While I want to believe all of this myself, I find it to be very hard.
However, feeling bad won't help me or anyone else for that matter.</p>
