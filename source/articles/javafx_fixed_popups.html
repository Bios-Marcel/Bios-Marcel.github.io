<p>
    I am currently working on a small autocompletion text field. I want the
    component to show a small popup with completion possibilities whenever any are
    available at the current cursor location.
</p>

<p>
    I thought "That's gotta be easy, just call <code>new Popup()</code> and invoke
    <code>show()</code> ... well, it didn't work too well. The popup would
    initially show correctly, but also not hide clicking anywhere. This is due
    to the fact you have to set `autoHide` to `true`.
</p>

<p>
    After setting <code>autoHide</code>, it would however hide when you move the window or
    click in some area that can't receive focus anyway. This means the text field
    would still have focus, but no popup showing. This is quite annoying, as this
    means we can't bind the popup visiblity to the focus. While a workaround would
    be to listen to <code>KeyEvent</code> and <code>MouseEvent</code> to re-show
    the popup, this is janky.
</p>

<p>
    Time to make my own popup I guess?
    I found an <a href="https://quollwriter.wordpress.com/2019/04/08/how-to-create-a-popup-pane-in-javafx/">
        interesting post guiding me the right way</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This solution would allow me to freely place any component inside of a
    <code>Pane</code>. The only issue with this solution, is that it changes
    the bounds of the popups parent. So our hierarchy Would Be
    <code>Pane(TextField, Popup)</code>.
</p>

<p>
    To solve the layouting issue, the following rough setup is required:
</p>

<code>
    <pre>
        final var textField = new TextField("I am a TextField");

        final var popup = new Label("I am a Popup");
        popup.setVisible(false);
        popup.setManaged(false);

        final var pane = new Pane();
        pane.getChildren().addAll(textField, popup);
        pane.maxHeightProperty().bind(textField.heightProperty());
        pane.maxWidthProperty().bind(textField.widthProperty());

        showPopup();
    </pre>
</code>

Calling <code>setManaged(false)</code> on the <code>popup</code> will prevent
it from being layouted, but also prevent it from expanding the parent in size.
Since the parent is now bound to the size of the <code>textField</code>, we
won't be pushing other components in the layout.

However, since <code>popup</code> isn't being layouted, it does not have a position.
While the methods <code>setLayoutX</code> and <code>setLayoutY</code> exist, they
have no effect, as we are effectively not part of a layout. Instead we need to
call <code>setTranslateY</code> and <code>setTranslateX</code>:

<code>
    <pre>
        private void showPopup() {
            popup.setVisible(true);
            final var textFieldBounds = textField.getBoundsInParent();
            popup.setTranslateY(textFieldBounds.getMaxY());
            popup.setTranslateX(textFieldBounds.getMinX());
            ...
        }
    </pre>
</code>

<p>
    In order to show the text field, we need to always bring all components in its
    hierarchy to the front, as the popup will otherwise render partially behind
    other components in any nested layout. However, calling
    <code>Node#toFront</code> will actually reposition the nodes. Instead, we set
    the <code>viewOrder</code> to a negative value for the full node hierarchy:
</p>

<code>
    <pre>
        private void showPopup() {
            ...
            toFront(popup);
        }

        private void toFront(Node node) {
            node.setViewOrder(-1);
            if (node.getParent() != null) {
                toFront(node.getParent());
            }
        }
    </pre>
</code>

<p>
I hope someone can make use of this wild hack ðŸ˜€
