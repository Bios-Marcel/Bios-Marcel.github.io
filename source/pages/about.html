title: About

---

<p>I am {{.Author}},&nbsp;<span id="age"><noscript>25+</noscript></span>&nbsp;years old
    and live in Germany. I am currently working as a Java developer. The
    preferred language for most of my hobby projects is Golang, which I also
    used to do professionally in the past.</p>

<p>On this blog Iâ€™ll occasionally write about random experiences and thoughts,
    but mostly related to programming.</p>

<h2>My projects</h2>

<p>99% of what I've done can be found on my GitHub page:
